#### Disa PC File Manager

This gui application allows you to extract and insert files into Disgaea PC .DAT and .MPP files.
Note that the position of most files in .DAT is hardcoded, deleting files could break the file order and so the archive itself.

#### Sprite Sheet Viewer

This gui application allows you to view and extract Disgaea PC sprite sheets (as .png or .tga).
Currently it is very basic.
